# Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the Terminal-Based Python Exam System to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- A Vercel account (free tier works fine)
- Git installed locally
- Node.js and npm installed (for Vercel CLI)

## System Overview

This is a **submission-only system**:

- **Student Identification**: Collects Enrollment ID, Full Name, and Exam Code
- **Vercel Blob Hosting**: Exam files are hosted on Vercel Blob Storage (no GitHub files needed)
- **Smart Submission Naming**: Files named as `{EXAM_CODE}_{ENROLLMENT_ID}.zip` (e.g., `cst101_STU12345.zip`)
- **Automatic Overwrite**: Only the last submission from each student is kept
- **File Pattern**: Uses `prob_*` for solution files
- **Time Tracking**: Complete audit trail stored in `student_info.txt`
- **Manual Grading**: TAs download submissions from Blob Storage for local grading

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Method 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

This is the easiest and most maintainable approach.

#### 1. Fork or Push to GitHub

```bash
# Fork this repository on GitHub, or push to your own repo
git clone https://github.com/abirmondal/py-exam-cli.git
cd py-exam-cli

# If creating your own repo:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### 2. Import to Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click **Add New... > Project**
3. Click **Import** next to your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will detect the configuration automatically

#### 3. Deploy

Click **Deploy** (no environment variables needed for submission-only system)

#### 4. Set Up Blob Storage

After deployment completes:

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to **Storage** tab
2. Click **Create Database**
3. Select **Blob**
4. Choose a name (e.g., "exam-storage")
5. Click **Create**

Vercel will automatically configure the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` environment variable.

#### 5. Get Your Blob Storage URL

In the Storage section, you'll see your Blob Storage URL:
```
https://[your-project-id].blob.vercel-storage.com
```

#### 6. Update setup.sh

Update the URLs in `setup.sh`:

```bash
# Around line 63:
VERCEL_BLOB_BASE_URL="https://your-actual-blob-url.blob.vercel-storage.com"

# Around line 241 (in submit.sh):
API_URL="https://your-project.vercel.app/api/submit"
```

Commit and push to GitHub:
```bash
git add setup.sh
git commit -m "Update deployment URLs"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically detect the push and redeploy!

#### 7. Future Updates

Just commit and push to your main branch:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
```

Vercel automatically redeploys on every push.

---

### Method 2: Vercel CLI (Advanced)

For users who prefer command-line deployment.

#### 1. Fork or Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abirmondal/py-exam-cli.git
cd py-exam-cli
```

#### 2. Customize URLs

Open `setup.sh` and update the Vercel Blob URL (around line 63):

```bash
# Change this line:
VERCEL_BLOB_BASE_URL="https://[YOUR-VERCEL-PROJECT-ID].blob.vercel-storage.com"

# To your actual Vercel Blob Storage URL:
VERCEL_BLOB_BASE_URL="https://your-actual-blob-url.blob.vercel-storage.com"
```

You can find your Vercel Blob Storage URL in your Vercel project's Storage settings.

#### 3. Install Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

#### 4. Login to Vercel

```bash
vercel login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Vercel account.

#### 5. Deploy the Project

```bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

The CLI will guide you through:
- Linking to an existing project or creating a new one
- Configuring project settings
- Deploying the application

### 6. Configure Vercel Blob Storage

The system uses Vercel Blob Storage for:
- Hosting exam files (in `public-exams/` path)
- Storing student submissions (in `submissions/` path)

**Setup Steps:**

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to **Storage**
2. Click **Create Database**
3. Select **Blob**
4. Choose a name for your store (e.g., "exam-submissions")
5. Click **Create**

Vercel will automatically configure the necessary environment variables for Blob Storage (`BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`).

**Get Your Blob Storage URL:**

After creating Blob Storage, you'll receive a URL like:
```
https://[your-project-id].blob.vercel-storage.com
```

Save this URL - you'll need it for updating `setup.sh` in the next step.

### 7. Update API URL in setup.sh

After deployment, Vercel will give you a URL (e.g., `https://your-project.vercel.app`).

You need to update the API URL in the `setup.sh` file that gets dynamically created.

Edit `setup.sh` around line 162 (within the submit.sh HEREDOC) and change:

```bash
API_URL="https://your-vercel-deployment.vercel.app/api/submit"
```

To your actual Vercel URL:

```bash
API_URL="https://your-project-name.vercel.app/api/submit"
```

### 9. Commit and Push Changes

```bash
git add setup.sh
git commit -m "Update URLs for deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 10. Redeploy (if needed)

If you made changes after the initial deployment:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Verify Deployment

### Test the API

1. Visit your Vercel URL in a browser: `https://your-project.vercel.app`
2. You should see a JSON response with API information

### Test Submission Endpoint

```bash
# Create a test zip file
cd /tmp
echo "Test content" > test.txt
zip test.zip test.txt

# Test the submission
curl -X POST -F "file=@test.zip" https://your-project.vercel.app/api/submit
```

You should get a success response.



## Add Exam Files

### 1. Create Your Exam Content

```bash
mkdir exam_content
cd exam_content

# Create solution files using prob_* pattern
echo "# Student solution for Problem 1" > prob_1.py
echo "# Student solution for Problem 2" > prob_2.py
echo "Answer for problem 3:" > prob_3.txt
```

### 2. Create the Zip File

```bash
zip -r myexam101.zip prob_*
```

### 3. Upload to Vercel Blob Storage

You have two options to upload exam files:

**Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** → **Blob**
3. Create a folder path: `public-exams/`
4. Upload `myexam101.zip` to this folder

**Option 2: Via Vercel CLI**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm install -g vercel

# Upload the exam file
vercel blob upload myexam101.zip --token YOUR_TOKEN

# Or upload to a specific path
# (Note: Exact CLI syntax may vary, check Vercel docs)
```

The exam will be immediately available at:
```
https://your-blob-url.blob.vercel-storage.com/public-exams/myexam101.zip
```

## Student Instructions

### Distribute to Students

1. **Setup Script URL**:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/setup.sh
   ```

2. **Instructions for Students**:
   ```
   1. Download setup script:
      curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/setup.sh
   
   2. Make it executable:
      chmod +x setup.sh
   
   3. Run setup:
      ./setup.sh
   
   4. Enter your Enrollment ID when prompted
   5. Enter your Full Name when prompted
   6. Enter the Exam Code (e.g., cst101)
   7. Navigate to the exam directory:
      cd ~/exam_YOUR_ENROLLMENT_ID
   
   8. Start the exam (starts timer and unlocks solution files):
      ./start_exam.sh
   
   9. Complete the exam (edit solution files)
   
   10. Submit (locks files and submits):
       ./submit.sh
   ```

**Important Notes**:
- Files are read-only until `start_exam.sh` is run
- Time is tracked from start to submission
- Both Enrollment ID and Full Name are collected
- `student_info.txt` includes timing data for auditing

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### View Logs

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Deployments**
4. Click on a deployment
5. View **Functions** logs

### Download Submissions

This is a **submission-only system**. To grade exams:

1. **Go to your Vercel Project Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Storage** → Select your Blob store
3. **Browse the `submissions/` folder**
4. **Download submission files** - they're named as `{examcode}_{enrollmentid}.zip`
   - Example: `cst101_STU12345.zip`
5. **Unzip and grade** using your preferred tools/methods

**Each submission contains:**
- `prob_*` files (student solutions)
- `student_info.txt` (enrollment ID, name, exam code, timing data)

**Note**: Only the last submission from each student is kept (previous submissions are automatically overwritten).

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Fails

**Error**: "No build matches your repository"
- **Solution**: Make sure `vercel.json` is in the repository root

**Error**: "Failed to install dependencies"
- **Solution**: Check that `requirements.txt` is valid
- Try: `pip install -r requirements.txt` locally first
- Ensure all dependencies are available: fastapi, uvicorn, python-multipart, vercel-blob

### API Errors

**Error**: "Failed to save submission"
- **Solution**: Ensure Vercel Blob Storage is configured
- Check that the BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN is set (automatic with Blob)

### Students Can't Download Exams

**Error**: "Invalid Exam Code or network issue"
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify the exam zip file exists in Vercel Blob Storage under `public-exams/`
  2. Check the `VERCEL_BLOB_BASE_URL` in `setup.sh` is correct
  3. Ensure the blob is accessible (public access enabled)
  4. Test the URL in a browser: `https://your-blob-url.blob.vercel-storage.com/public-exams/examcode.zip`
  5. Check Vercel Blob Storage logs in the dashboard

### Submissions Fail

**Error**: "Submission FAILED"
- **Solution**:
  1. Check the Vercel deployment URL is correct in `setup.sh`
  2. Verify the API endpoint is working
  3. Check file size (must be < 10MB)
  4. Test with: `curl -X POST -F "file=@submission.zip" https://your-url/api/submit`

## System Workflow Summary

### For Students:
1. Download and run `setup.sh`
2. Provide Enrollment ID and Full Name
3. Enter Exam Code
4. System downloads exam from Vercel Blob Storage
5. System creates `student_info.txt` with ID and name
6. All files set to read-only for integrity
7. Run `start_exam.sh` to begin (starts timer, unlocks solution files)
8. Complete exam in isolated directory
9. Run `submit.sh` to upload (locks files, records end time, includes all timing data)

### For Instructors:
1. Create exam zip files with `prob_*` pattern
2. Upload to Vercel Blob Storage under `public-exams/`
3. Students take exam and submit as `{EXAM_CODE}_{ENROLLMENT_ID}.zip`
4. Download submissions from Vercel Blob Storage `submissions/` folder
5. Unzip and grade using preferred methods/tools
6. Access complete timing data in each submission's `student_info.txt`

## 🔄 Syncing Updates from the Template

When you create a repository from this template, it's a one-time copy. It does not automatically receive updates if the main template is improved or fixed.

To pull in new updates from the main template, you must add it as a remote (you only need to do this once):

```bash
# 1. Add the main template as a remote named "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/abirmondal/py-exam-cli.git
```

Then, whenever you want to check for and merge updates:

```bash
# 2. Fetch the latest changes from the template
git fetch upstream

# 3. Merge the changes from the template's main branch into your main branch
git merge upstream/main
```

**Note:** If you have made your own changes to files that also changed in the template (like `setup.sh`), you may have to resolve merge conflicts.

After syncing updates, remember to redeploy to Vercel:

```bash
# If using GitHub integration, just push:
git push origin main

# If using Vercel CLI:
vercel --prod
```

## Conclusion

Your Terminal-Based Python Exam System is now deployed and ready to use! Students can download the setup script, take exams, and submit their work. You download submissions from Blob Storage for manual/local grading.

For production use, make sure to:
